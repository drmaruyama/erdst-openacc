This is an EXPERIMENTAL version. The corresponding slvfe command is https://github.com/drmaruyama/slvfe-openacc.
(For information about the original code, see https://sourceforge.net/projects/ermod/.)

ERmod (Energy Representation Module) is a program to calculate the solvation free energy based on the energy representation method. The program allows users to calculate the solvation free energy in arbitrary solvent, including inhomogeneous systems, and runs in cooperation with state-of-art molecular simulation softwares, such as NAMD, GROMACS, and AMBER.

## Requirements
- NVIDIA HPC SDK (https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk)
- BLAS & LAPACK library (BLAS and LAPACK, OpenBLAS, MKL etc)

## Typical Installation
This package is built with autotools. To compile the program,
1. configure the package with "configure",
2. then compile the package with "make".

If you have Intel MKL, configure program with:
    $ ./configure --with-mkl

If your computer has OpenBLAS library, try:
    $ ./configure --with-openblas

If configuration finishes successfully, type
    $ make
to start compilation.

## Non-typical Installation
If you want to use a specific version of Intel MKL, try
    ./configure --with-mkl=(version number) 

If you want to set the path for OpenBLAS library, try
    ./configure --with-openblas=(Path to library)

Current configuration script only supports nvfortran as a compiler.
